#define CATCH_CONFIG_MAIN  // This tells Catch to provide a main() - only do this in one cpp file
#include <catch.hpp>

// Note: You should probably not place any tests in here. Including catch.hpp
// on its own will allow faster incremental compilation, as all the types
// from catch.hpp can be instantiated once. Prefer to put your tests
// in other source files.
